# Theory of Computation - Day 1

## Why learn about the history of computation?
- We're learning about the past to understand the future.
- By learning about the things that haven't changed in the past 200+ years it gives us insight into the next 50 years of computing.

## Arrays
- Stores a sequence of elements
- Each element is of the same data type
- Occupies a contiguous block
- Can access data in constant time with this equation: memory address = starting address + (index * data size)
