## What is an algorithm?

- A set of instructions.
- A series of steps and rules to solve a problem.
- A recipe.

### Examples

- Crossing the street
  1. Look left.
  2. If no cars are coming. no_cars == true
  3. Look right
  4. If no cars are coming. no_cars == true
  5. Walk across the street.
- Starting your car.
- Traffic lights.

## How do we solve an algorithmic problem?

1. Understand the problem. Restate the crux of the problem in your own words.
2. Devise a plan. State out what you want to do in plain english. Write it out in pseudocode. Try to poke holes in your plan.
3. Carry out your plan. Write the code. Get a first pass solution.
4. Look back. Evaluate the Big-O of your solution. Try to improve it.
