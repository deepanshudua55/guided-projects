# You are planning to rob houses on a specific street, and you know that every house on the street has a certain amount of money hidden. The only thing stopping you from robbing all of them in one night is that adjacent houses on the street have a connected security system. The system will automatically trigger an alarm if two adjacent houses are broken into on the same night.
# â€‹
# Given a list of non-negative integers nums representing the amount of money hidden in each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob in one night without triggering an alarm

# Input:
# nums: [1, 1, 1]

# 2

# Input:
